# Quantitative TALE

The Mathematica code underlying the analysis of a published scientific paper is hosted here in the interests of reproducibility.

The code requires Mathematica 10 and has been tested on 10.3.1. 

The top-level directory contains the Mathematica script files, which can be run from the command line, for example:
```
math -script qTALEManuscriptFigures_eve.wl
```

The project has the following directory structure:

| Directory     | Content     |
|:------------- |:------------|
| data          | The _rhomboid_ wild-type and TALE data underlying Figure 3 in the paper. | 
| externalData  | The data kindly supplied by D. Papatsenko and H. Janssens.   |
| Figures       | The figures generated by the Mathematica script files, with the subdirectories corresponding to the figures of the published paper.      | 
| packages      | Mathematica package files used by the script files. The BDTNP.wl package file includes public data from the [Berkeley Drosophila Transcription Network Project](http://bdtnp.lbl.gov/Fly-Net/bioimaging.jsp?w=summary). The code to generate this package can be found at https://github.com/ilsley/wlBDTNP.  |
